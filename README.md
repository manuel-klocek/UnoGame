## Motivation

Develop an own UNO related application in multiple versions:

- Version 1.0: Creating the UNO application as console project
- Version 2.0: Migrate the console project to a Unity Project with GUI and more functionality

## Documentation

### Version 1.0

#### First Milestone: Get a working MVP (Minimum Viable Product) 
- Work out the basic structure of the application process
- Develop the Card Models and Card Generation
- Develop the Player (and Deck) Generation with User-Input
- Shuffle the generated List of Cards
- Develop the basic application process (place/take card -> next players turn)
- Develop the Evaluation of Cards (only allowed Cards can be placed)
- Develop the "CardStack" so players can place Cards
- Develop the "TakeStack" so players can take Cards

#### Second Milestone: Implement special "Event-Cards"
- Definition of "Event-Cards" - *symbol for Event Cards in curly brackets*:
  - Wish-Color-Cards (==)
  - Penalty-Cards (+2)
  - Wish-Color-Penalty-Cards (+4)
  - Suspend-Cards (!!)
  - Change-Direction-Cards (<>)
- Work out the way of implementing this Event-Execution
- Edit current application process to enable direction changes
- Add Exceptionhandling:
  - If User does a wrong input (take / place) it stays at his turn
- Add functionality: 
  - After placing black card User is asked for color input
- At this stage experiencing unexpected loops:
  1. Determine the origin of the loop:
     1. If an Event Card is placed the application reacts to it (i.e. +2-Penalty-Card)
     2. Next player is called and Event Card is witnessed by application
     3. Event is called again -> resulting in a loop
  2. Fix Bug:
     1. Work out a solution to make the Event-Card "invisible" after executing
     2. Workaround: Placing a "transparent" Card over the Event-Card
        - *User can't see a Card on Top but "EventChecker" doesn't recognize the Event-Card anymore* 

###### At this stage we have a fully working product!

#### Third Milestone: Implement Bots
- Work out the way how the Bot should work
- Develop a hard-coded Bot which determines the best move to do
- Develop a method to determine the best color, if a Color-Determine-Card has been placed
- Implement the Bot-Logic to be called when it is his turn

###### At this stage we can let multiple Bots to play against each other!

### Version 2.0

#### Ubiquitous Language
- CardStack == The stack to place a Card to
- TakeStack == The stack to get a Card from if u can't place any


#### First Milestone: Get a working MVP in Unity
- Learn about the first steps in Unity
- Read through an example project to understand the Unity programming pattern
- Migrate and recode the console application in Unity
  1. Recode Cards as Prefabs, so they can get cloned and generated by Unity as GameObjects
  2. Develop the CardScript to use OnClick and OnHover Methods for User-Inputs
  3. Migrate the Rules as an Evaluation-Service
  4. Develop the GameManager to start and set up the project - *with mock players*
  5. Develop the Card Generation
     1. Develop a Card-Generator that is able to only generate needed Cards *(to save memory)*   
     2. Develop the generation of a deck per player
     3. Develop the generation of a single Card for the TakeStack
     4. Develop the generation of a single Card for the CardStack
  6. Develop the TakeStack and CardStack
  7. Develop the application process to call another player when move is done
     - Create the process with EventHandling
     - Create a service to hide the cards of other players and show own
  8. Create a service to sort cards by their color 
  9. Create a service to align the cards at the screen
  10. Implement and rewrite the Bots

###### At this stage we have a fully working product!

#### Second Milestone: Merging of modelling and functionality
